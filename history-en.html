  <h2>Our Story</h2>

  <p>
    Some plants are more than just plants.
    They carry memory, affection, and time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Aguatudo was born from a simple idea:
    caring for plants is often a way of caring for stories.
  </p>

  <h3>A legacy of care</h3>

  <p>
    This story begins at the countryside property of award-winning orchid grower
    <strong>Antonio Vendramin</strong> (1923–1996),
    in Jundiaí, São Paulo, Brazil.
  </p>

  <p>
    In an orchid house with more than <strong>10,000 orchid varieties</strong>,
    the care for each plant was treated with real attention.
    To support that, an irrigation system was installed with
    <strong>transparent micro-tubes running to each pot</strong> —
    remarkably innovative for the 1980s.
  </p>

  <p>
    That system was developed by <strong>Antonio Vendramin Filho</strong>,
    with a focus on regularity, precision, and respect for the plants’ rhythm.
  </p>

  <h3>From the orchid house to Aguatudo</h3>

  <p>
    Decades later, this same logic of care was revisited and advanced by
    Computer Engineer <strong>Fabio S. Vendramin</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Aguatudo is the natural continuation of that story:
    combining technology and sensitivity to make plant care
    simpler, reliable, and predictable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout development, modern solutions were incorporated —
    including custom firmware and a smartphone interface —
    always guided by one clear principle:
    <strong>don’t complicate what can be simple</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s why Aguatudo works without depending on the internet,
    can be operated with a single button,
    and keeps control in the hands of the person who cares.
  </p>

  <p>
    More than a product, Aguatudo is the continuation of a kind of care
    that crosses generations — now adapted to everyday modern life.
